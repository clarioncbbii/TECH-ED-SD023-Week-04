# REFLECTIONS

## Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

### Required:

- What requirements did you achieve?
- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

### Optional:

Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

- Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
- What went really well and what could have gone better?

## Tips

### Some general wisdom:

- The bigger picture is scary and overwhelming! Divide your project into smaller manageable steps (use the user stories to help you)
- Deploy as soon as possible! As soon as the first setup (template) is done, commit and push to GitHub, then deploy on Render
- Plan! Plan! Plan! PLAN!!!!! We are creating a full-stack application; you cannot just jump in. Channel your enthusiasm with focus. A plan keeps you focused
- The tutors want to see your learning journey. Don't be afraid to submit incomplete or broken code. They want a fair representation on your skills so feedback can be provided

### Also, some tech wisdom:

- For Supabase DB, create a new table within your existing course DB
- Every time we push code to GitHub, Render picks up the changes and redeploys automatically.
- Add the client link (from Render) on your GitHub repo
- When your deployment fails, and at some points it most certainly will...REMEMBER: DO NOT PANIC! READ THE ERROR LOG! USE THE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE!
